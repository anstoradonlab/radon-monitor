# Configuration for ANSTO two filter radon detector
# Basic config, one 1500 L detector

detectors:
  # detector_kind sets the type of radon detector.  Options are:
  #  "L1500" - standard 1500 litre detector
  #  "L200" - standard 200 litre detector
  #  "mock" - used for testing without a connected radon detector
  - kind: "mock"

    datalogger_serial: -1

calbox:
  # there are different kinds of calibration units.  The "generic" kind is the 
  # most common one, designed to interface with a single radon detector.
  # There is also a kind called "mock" which can be used for testing the software
  # but which doesn't try to connect to hardware.
  kind: "mock"
  # The labjack ID can be set in software.  A special value of -1 means
  # to use the first labjack found, which only makes sense if there is
  # only ever one labjack connected to the PC
  labjack_id: -1
  # Only use the labjack with the serial number specifed here.  A special
  # value of -1 means to ignore the serial number.
