# radon-monitor


Control and data logging for ANSTO's dual flow loop two filter radon detectors.


## Description


To some instructions for preparing a new computer are [provided here](https://github.com/anstoradonlab/radon-monitor/blob/main/user-docs/configuring-a-site.md).

For the moment, the best way to try this out is to download the GUI and install it on a Windows system.  The code runs on Linux also, but we are testing on Windows first. Our test system is running Windows 10.


## Versioning

Versions start at 10.0 to differentiate this software from a previous version written in Visual Basic.  Our plan is to increase the minor version (10.0 -> 10.1) for every release, unless we introduce a change which breaks forward compatibility with either the database or configuration file.  If we introduce an incompatible change, the major version will be increased (10.x -> 11.0)
